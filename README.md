# NetEngTK

NetEngTK (Network Engineering Toolkit) is a lightweight, self-contained Docker Compose lab environment designed for testing and validating network tools, protocols, and services. It spins up a simulated mini-datacenter on a single Linux machine (e.g., EC2) using containers.

## âš¡ What's Included

This toolkit launches the following services using Docker Compose:

| Service     | Description                       | Port(s)        |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| **Nginx**    | Web server (homepage test)        | 80             |
| **Speedtest**| Bandwidth measurement tool        | 8080           |
| **Syslog-NG**| Syslog listener                   | 514/udp        |
| **BIND**     | DNS server                        | 53/udp, 53/tcp |
| **vsftpd**   | FTP server                        | 21, 21100-21110 |
| **SNMPD**    | SNMP agent (public community)     | 161/udp        |
| **IPSec VPN**| L2TP/IPSec VPN server             | 500/udp, 4500/udp |

> Note: Ensure your EC2 security group allows inbound traffic on the required ports.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start on AWS EC2

1. Launch a **CentOS 7 or Amazon Linux 2** EC2 instance.
2. Paste the contents of `user-data.sh` into the **User Data** field at EC2 launch.
3. The script will:
   - Install Docker & Docker Compose
   - Download this repoâ€™s `init.sh` and `docker-compose.yml`
   - Launch all services via Docker Compose

After boot, verify it's working:

```bash
curl http://localhost          # Nginx
docker ps                     # See running containers
docker compose logs           # Check logs
